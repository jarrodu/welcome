# Welcome

Hello. This is my Github account. I don't have many public repositories. I also use AWS CodeCommit. So please don't think that this account is a good way of accessing my skills.

I build data processing systems. I generally use static functional programming languages such as Scala. My preference is to build on AWS and I practice infrastructure as code.

To learn more please see my personal [website](https://jarrod.de).
